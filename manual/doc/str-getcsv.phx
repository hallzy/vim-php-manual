*str_getcsv*

(PHP 5 >= 5.3.0, PHP 7)

str_getcsv â€” Parse a CSV string into an array

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  str_getcsv ( string $input [, string $delimiter = "," [, string~
  $enclosure = '"' [, string $escape = "\\" ]]] ) :~
  array~

Parses a string input for fields in CSV format and returns an array containing
the fields read.

  Note:

  The locale settings are taken into account by this function. If LC_CTYPE is
  e.g. en_US.UTF-8, strings in one-byte encodings may be read wrongly by this
  function.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{input}

  The string to parse.

{delimiter}

  Set the field delimiter (one character only).

{enclosure}

  Set the field enclosure character (one character only).

{escape}

  Set the escape character (at most one character). Defaults as a backslash (\)
  An empty string ("") disables the proprietary escape mechanism.

    Note: Usually an {enclosure} character is escaped inside a field by
    doubling it; however, the {escape} character can be used as an alternative.
    So for the default parameter values "" and \" have the same meaning. Other
    than allowing to escape the {enclosure} character the {escape} character
    has no special meaning; it isn't even meant to escape itself.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns an indexed array containing the fields read.
