*session_write_close*

(PHP 4 >= 4.0.4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

session_write_close â€” Write session data and end session

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  session_write_close ( void ) : bool~

End the current session and store session data.

Session data is usually stored after your script terminated without the need to
call session_write_close(), but as session data is locked to prevent concurrent
writes only one script may operate on a session at any time. When using
framesets together with sessions you will experience the frames loading one by
one due to this locking. You can reduce the time needed to load all the frames
by ending the session as soon as all changes to session variables are done.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
