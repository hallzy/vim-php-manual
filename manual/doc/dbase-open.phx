*dbase_open*

(PHP 5 < 5.3.0, dbase 5, dbase 7)

dbase_open â€” Opens a database

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  dbase_open ( string $filename , int $mode ) : resource~

dbase_open() opens a dBase database with the given access mode.

  Note: When safe mode is enabled, PHP checks whether the files or directories
  being operated upon have the same UID (owner) as the script that is being
  executed.

  Note:

  This function is affected by open_basedir.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{filename}

  The name of the database. It can be a relative or absolute path to the file
  where dBase will store your data.

{mode}

  An integer which correspond to those for the `open()` system call (Typically
  0 means read-only, 1 means write-only, and 2 means read and write).

    Note:

    You can't open a dBase file in write-only mode as the function will fail to
    read the headers information and thus you can't use 1 as {mode}.

  As of dbase 7.0.0 you can use DBASE_RDONLY and DBASE_RDWR, respectively, to
  specify the {mode}.

===============================================================================
