[ Return Values ]

If {opt} is given, returns its value. Otherwise, returns an associative array
with the following elements (which correspond to {opt}), or FALSE on failure:

 * "url"
 * "content_type"
 * "http_code"
 * "header_size"
 * "request_size"
 * "filetime"
 * "ssl_verify_result"
 * "redirect_count"
 * "total_time"
 * "namelookup_time"
 * "connect_time"
 * "pretransfer_time"
 * "size_upload"
 * "size_download"
 * "speed_download"
 * "speed_upload"
 * "download_content_length"
 * "upload_content_length"
 * "starttransfer_time"
 * "redirect_time"
 * "certinfo"
 * "primary_ip"
 * "primary_port"
 * "local_ip"
 * "local_port"
 * "redirect_url"
 * "request_header" (This is only set if the CURLINFO_HEADER_OUT is set by a
  previous call to |curl_setopt|)

Note that private data is not included in the associative array and must be
retrieved individually with the CURLINFO_PRIVATE option.

[ Examples ]

Example #1 curl_getinfo() example

<?php >
  // Create a cURL handle
  $ch = curl_init('http://www.example.com/');

  // Execute
  curl_exec($ch);

  // Check if any error occurred
  if (!curl_errno($ch)) {
    $info = curl_getinfo($ch);
    echo 'Took ', $info['total_time'], ' seconds to send a request to ', $info[
  'url'], "\n";
  }

  // Close handle
  curl_close($ch);
<?>

Example #2 curl_getinfo() example with {opt} parameter

<?php >
  // Create a cURL handle
  $ch = curl_init('http://www.example.com/');

  // Execute
  curl_exec($ch);

  // Check HTTP status code
  if (!curl_errno($ch)) {
    switch ($http_code = curl_getinfo($ch, CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE)) {
      case 200:  # OK
        break;
      default:
        echo 'Unexpected HTTP code: ', $http_code, "\n";

  Note:

  Information gathered by this function is kept if the handle is re-used. This
  means that unless a statistic is overridden internally by this function, the
  previous info is returned.
