*stream_set_blocking*

(PHP 4 >= 4.3.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

stream_set_blocking â€” Set blocking/non-blocking mode on a stream

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  stream_set_blocking ( resource $stream , bool $mode ) : bool~

Sets blocking or non-blocking mode on a {stream}.

This function works for any stream that supports non-blocking mode (currently,
regular files and socket streams).

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{stream}

  The stream.

{mode}

  If {mode} is FALSE, the given stream will be switched to non-blocking mode,
  and if TRUE, it will be switched to blocking mode. This affects calls like 
  |fgets| and |fread| that read from the stream. In non-blocking mode an |fgets|
  call will always return right away while in blocking mode it will wait for
  data to become available on the stream.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

===============================================================================
[ Notes ]

  Note:

  This function was previously called as |set_socket_blocking| and later 
  |socket_set_blocking| but this usage is deprecated.

  Note:

  On Windows, this has no affect on local files. Non-blocking IO for local
  files is not supported on Windows.
