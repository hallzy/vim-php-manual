*utf8_encode*

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

utf8_encode — Encodes an ISO-8859-1 string to UTF-8

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  utf8_encode ( string $data ) : string~

This function converts the string {data} from the ISO-8859-1 encoding to UTF-8.

  Note:

  Many web pages marked as using the ISO-8859-1 character encoding actually use
  the similar Windows-1252 encoding, and web browsers will interpret ISO-8859-1
  web pages as Windows-1252. Windows-1252 features additional printable
  characters, such as the Euro sign (€) and curly quotes (“ ”), instead of
  certain ISO-8859-1 control characters. This function will not convert such
  Windows-1252 characters correctly. Use a different function if Windows-1252
  conversion is required.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{data}

  An ISO-8859-1 string.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns the UTF-8 translation of {data}.
