*realpath*

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

realpath â€” Returns canonicalized absolute pathname

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  realpath ( string $path ) : string~

realpath() expands all symbolic links and resolves references to /./, /../ and
extra / characters in the input {path} and returns the canonicalized absolute
pathname.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{path}

  The path being checked.


    Note:

    Whilst a path must be supplied, the value can be an empty string. In this
    case, the value is interpreted as the current directory.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns the canonicalized absolute pathname on success. The resulting path will
have no symbolic link, /./ or /../ components. Trailing delimiters, such as \
and /, are also removed.

realpath() returns FALSE on failure, e.g. if the file does not exist.

  Note:

  The running script must have executable permissions on all directories in the
  hierarchy, otherwise realpath() will return FALSE.

  Note:

  For case-insensitive filesystems realpath() may or may not normalize the
  character case.

  Note:

  The function realpath() will not work for a file which is inside a Phar as
  such path would be a virtual path, not a real one.

  Note: Because PHP's integer type is signed and many platforms use 32bit
  integers, some filesystem functions may return unexpected results for files
  which are larger than 2GB.

[ Changelog ]

Version                               Description
        Prior to this release, if only the last {path} component did not exist,
5.3.0   realpath() would not fail on *BSD systems. realpath() now fails in this
        case.
5.2.1   Prior to this version, realpath() returned FALSE if {path} is an empty
        string or NULL.

===============================================================================
[ Examples ]

Example #1 realpath() example

<?php >
  chdir('/var/www/');
  echo realpath('./../../etc/passwd') . PHP_EOL;

  echo realpath('/tmp/') . PHP_EOL;
<?>

The above example will output:

/etc/passwd
/tmp

Example #2 realpath() on Windows

On windows realpath() will change unix style paths to windows style.

<?php >
  echo realpath('/windows/system32'), PHP_EOL;

  echo realpath('C:\Program Files\\'), PHP_EOL;
<?>

The above example will output:

C:\WINDOWS\System32
C:\Program Files
