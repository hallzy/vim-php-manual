[ Parameters ]

{mh}

{option}

  One of the CURLMOPT_* constants.

{value}

  The value to be set on {option}.

  {value} should be an int for the following values of the {option} parameter:

                 Option                             Set {value} to
                                       Pass 1 to enable or 0 to disable.
                                       Enabling pipelining on a multi handle
                                       will make it attempt to perform HTTP
                                       Pipelining as far as possible for
                                       transfers using this handle. This means
                                       that if you add a second request that
  CURLMOPT_PIPELINING                  can use an already existing connection,
                                       the second request will be "piped" on
                                       the same connection. As of cURL 7.43.0
                                       you can also pass 2 to try to multiplex
                                       the new transfer over an existing HTTP/2
                                       connection if possible. Instead of
                                       integer literals, you can also use the
                                       CURLPIPE_* constants if available.
                                       Pass a number that will be used as the
                                       maximum amount of simultaneously open
                                       connections that libcurl may cache. By
                                       default the size will be enlarged to fit
  CURLMOPT_MAXCONNECTS                 four times the number of handles added
                                       via |curl_multi_add_handle|. When the
                                       cache is full, curl closes the oldest
                                       one in the cache to prevent the number
                                       of open connections from increasing.
                                       Pass a number that specifies the chunk
  CURLMOPT_CHUNK_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE   length threshold for pipelining in
                                       bytes.
                                       Pass a number that specifies the size
  CURLMOPT_CONTENT_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE threshold for pipelining penalty in
                                       bytes.
  CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS        Pass a number that specifies the maximum
                                       number of connections to a single host.
  CURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH         Pass a number that specifies the maximum
                                       number of requests in a pipeline.
                                       Pass a number that specifies the maximum
  CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS       number of simultaneously open
                                       connections.
                                       Pass a callable that will be registered
                                       to handle server pushes and should have
                                       the following signature:

                                       pushfunction ( resource $parent_ch ,
                                       resource $pushed_ch , array $headers )~
                                       : int~

                                       {parent_ch}

                                         The parent cURL handle (the request
                                         the client made).
  CURLMOPT_PUSHFUNCTION
                                       {pushed_ch}

                                         A new cURL handle for the pushed
                                         request.

                                       {headers}

                                         The push promise headers.

                                       The push function is supposed to return
                                       either CURL_PUSH_OK if it can handle the
                                       push, or CURL_PUSH_DENY to reject it.
