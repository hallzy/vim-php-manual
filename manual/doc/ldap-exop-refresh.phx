*ldap_exop_refresh*

(PHP 7 >= 7.3.0)

ldap_exop_refresh â€” Refresh extended operation helper

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  ldap_exop_refresh ( resource $link , string $dn , int $ttl ) : int~

Performs a Refresh extended operation and returns the data.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{link}

  An LDAP link identifier, returned by |ldap_connect|.

{dn}

  dn of the entry to refresh.

{ttl}

  Time in seconds (between 1 and 31557600) that the client requests that the
  entry exists in the directory before being automatically removed.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

From RFC: The responseTtl field is the time in seconds which the server chooses
to have as the time-to-live field for that entry. It must not be any smaller
than that which the client requested, and it may be larger. However, to allow
servers to maintain a relatively accurate directory, and to prevent clients
from abusing the dynamic extensions, servers are permitted to shorten a
client-requested time-to-live value, down to a minimum of 86400 seconds (one
day). FALSE will be returned on error.
