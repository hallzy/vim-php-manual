*win32_start_service_ctrl_dispatcher*

(PECL win32service >=0.1.0)

win32_start_service_ctrl_dispatcher â€” Registers the script with the SCM, so
that it can act as the service with the given name

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  win32_start_service_ctrl_dispatcher ( string $name [, bool $gracefulMode =~
  true ] ) : mixed~

When launched via the Service Control Manager, a service process is required to
"check-in" with it to establish service monitoring and communication
facilities. This function performs the check-in by spawning a thread to handle
the lower-level communication with the service control manager.

Once started, the service process should do 2 things. The first is to tell the
Service Control Manager that the service is running. This is achieved by
calling |win32_set_service_status| with the WIN32_SERVICE_RUNNING constant. If
you need to perform some lengthy process before the service is actually
running, then you can use the WIN32_SERVICE_START_PENDING constant. The second
is to continue to check-in with the service control manager so that it can
determine if it should terminate. This is achieved by periodically calling 
|win32_get_last_control_message| and handling the return code appropriately.

Caution

Since version 0.2.0, this function work only in "cli" SAPI. On other SAPI this
function is disabled.

===============================================================================
