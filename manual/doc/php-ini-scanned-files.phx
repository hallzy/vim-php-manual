*php_ini_scanned_files*

(PHP 4 >= 4.3.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

php_ini_scanned_files â€” Return a list of .ini files parsed from the additional
ini dir

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  php_ini_scanned_files ( void ) : string~

php_ini_scanned_files() returns a comma-separated list of configuration files
parsed after php.ini. The directories searched are set by a compile time option
and, optionally, by an environment variable at run time: more information can
be found in the installation guide.

The returned configuration files include the full path.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns a comma-separated string of .ini files on success. Each comma is
followed by a newline. If the configure directive --with-config-file-scan-dir
wasn't set and the PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR environment variable isn't set, FALSE is
returned. If it was set and the directory was empty, an empty string is
returned. If a file is unrecognizable, the file will still make it into the
returned string but a PHP error will also result. This PHP error will be seen
both at compile time and while using php_ini_scanned_files().

===============================================================================
[ Examples ]

Example #1 A simple example to list the returned ini files

<?php >
  if ($filelist = php_ini_scanned_files()) {
      if (strlen($filelist) > 0) {
          $files = explode(',', $filelist);

          foreach ($files as $file) {
              echo "<li>" . trim($file) . "</li>\n";
          }
      }
  }
<?>
