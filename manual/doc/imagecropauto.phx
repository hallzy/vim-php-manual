*imagecropauto*

(PHP 5 >= 5.5.0, PHP 7)

imagecropauto â€” Crop an image automatically using one of the available modes

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  imagecropauto ( resource $image [, int $mode = IMG_CROP_DEFAULT [, float~
  $threshold = .5 [, int $color = -1 ]]] ) : resource~

Automatically crops an image according to the given {mode}.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{ image}

  An image resource, returned by one of the image creation functions, such as 
  |imagecreatetruecolor|.

{mode}

  One of the following constants:

  IMG_CROP_DEFAULT
    Same as IMG_CROP_TRANSPARENT. Before PHP 7.4.0, the bundled libgd fell back
    to IMG_CROP_SIDES, if the image had no transparent color.
  IMG_CROP_TRANSPARENT
    Crops out a transparent background.
  IMG_CROP_BLACK
    Crops out a black background.
  IMG_CROP_WHITE
    Crops out a white background.
  IMG_CROP_SIDES
    Uses the 4 corners of the image to attempt to detect the background to
    crop.
  IMG_CROP_THRESHOLD
    Crops an image using the given {threshold} and {color}.

{threshold}

  Specifies the tolerance in percent to be used while comparing the image color
  and the color to crop. The method used to calculate the color difference is
  based on the color distance in the RGB(a) cube.

  Used only in IMG_CROP_THRESHOLD mode.

    Note: Before PHP 7.4.0, the bundled libgd used a somewhat different
    algorithm, so the same {threshold} yielded different results for system and
    bundled libgd.

{color}

  Either an RGB color value or a palette index.

  Used only in IMG_CROP_THRESHOLD mode.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns a cropped image resource on success or FALSE on failure. If the
complete image was cropped, |imagecrop| returns FALSE.

[ Changelog ]

Version                               Description
        The behavior of imagecropauto() in the bundled libgd has been synced
7.4.0   with that of system libgd: IMG_CROP_DEFAULT no longer falls back to
        IMG_CROP_SIDES and threshold-cropping now uses the same algorithm as
        system libgd.
        The default value of {mode} has been changed to IMG_CROP_AUTO.
7.4.0   Formerly, the default value has been -1 which corresponds to
        IMG_CROP_DEFAULT, but passing -1 is now deprecated.

===============================================================================
[ Examples ]

Example #1 Proper handling of auto-cropping

As noted in the return value section, imagecropauto() returns FALSE if the
whole image was cropped. In this example we have an image resource $im which
should be automatically cropped only if there is something to crop; otherwise
we want to proceed with the original image.

<?php >
  $cropped = imagecropauto($im, IMG_CROP_DEFAULT);
  if ($cropped !== false) { // in case a new image resource was returned
      imagedestroy($im);    // we destroy the original image
      $im = $cropped;       // and assign the cropped image to $im
  }
<?>
