*dbase_get_record_with_names*

(PHP 5 < 5.3.0, dbase 5, dbase 7)

dbase_get_record_with_names â€” Gets a record from a database as an associative
array

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  dbase_get_record_with_names ( resource $dbase_identifier , int~
  $record_number ) : array~

Gets a record from a dBase database as an associative array.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{dbase_identifier}

  The database link identifier, returned by |dbase_open| or |dbase_create|.

{record_number}

  The index of the record between 1 and dbase_numrecords($dbase_identifier).

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

An associative array with the record. This will also include a key named
deleted which is set to 1 if the record has been marked for deletion (see 
|dbase_delete_record|). Therefore it is not possible to retrieve the value of a
field named deleted with this function.

Each field is converted to the appropriate PHP type, except:

 * Dates are left as strings.
 * DateTime values are converted to strings.
 * Integers outside the range PHP_INT_MIN..PHP_INT_MAX are returned as strings.
 * Before dbase 7.0.0, booleans (L) were converted to 1 or 0.

On error, dbase_get_record_with_names() will return FALSE.

===============================================================================
[ Changelog ]

  Version                         Description
dbase 7.0.0 {dbase_identifier} is now a resource instead of an int.

===============================================================================
