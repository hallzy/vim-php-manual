(PHP 4 >= 4.0.1, PHP 5)

spliti â€” Split string into array by regular expression case insensitive

Warning

This function was DEPRECATED in PHP 5.3.0, and REMOVED in PHP 7.0.0.

Alternatives to this function include:

 * |preg_split| (with the i (PCRE_CASELESS) modifier)

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  spliti ( string $pattern , string $string [, int $limit = -1 ] ) : array~

Splits a {string} into array by regular expression.

This function is identical to |split| except that this ignores case distinction
when matching alphabetic characters.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{pattern}

  Case insensitive regular expression.

  If you want to split on any of the characters which are considered special by
  regular expressions, you'll need to escape them first. If you think spliti()
  (or any other regex function, for that matter) is doing something weird,
  please read the file regex.7, included in the regex/ subdirectory of the PHP
  distribution. It's in manpage format, so you'll want to do something along
  the lines of `man` `/usr/local/src/regex/regex.7` in order to read it.

{string}

  The input string.

{limit}

  If {limit} is set, the returned array will contain a maximum of {limit}
  elements with the last element containing the whole rest of {string}.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns an array of strings, each of which is a substring of {string} formed by
splitting it on boundaries formed by the case insensitive regular expression
{pattern}.

If there are n occurrences of {pattern}, the returned array will contain n+1
items. For example, if there is no occurrence of {pattern}, an array with only
one element will be returned. Of course, this is also true if {string} is
empty. If an error occurs, spliti() returns FALSE.

===============================================================================
[ Examples ]

This example splits a string using 'a' as the separator :

Example #1 spliti() example

<?php >
  $string = "aBBBaCCCADDDaEEEaGGGA";
  $chunks = spliti ("a", $string, 5);
  print_r($chunks);
<?>

The above example will output:

Array
(
  [0] =>
  [1] => BBB
  [2] => CCC
  [3] => DDD
  [4] => EEEaGGGA
)
